===============================

Hi {{ name }},

You RSVP'ed for an event on {{ date }}, but failed to attend. In the future, please change your RSVP to No if circumstances prevent you from attending. This gives people on the waiting list a chance to take your spot.

You currently have {{ no_show_count }} no-show{{ no_show_count == '1' ? '' : 's' }} on your record. If you accrue 3 no-shows within a year, your membership will be suspended for 3 months. If you have any questions about our attendance policy, please refer to http://chicagochinese.github.io/attendance-policy.html.
