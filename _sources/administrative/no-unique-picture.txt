No Unique Picture in Profile
============================

Hi {{name}},

Thanks for you interest in our meetup. In order for me to accept your membership request, please set a unique picture in your profile. It doesn't have to be a photo of yourself, but it cannot be a picture of a "person in silhouette".

Thanks,
Feihong
