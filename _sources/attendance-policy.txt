Attendance Policy
=================

If you RSVP for an event and later find out that you can't make it, please cancel your RSVP or notify the host. Otherwise, the host has the right to give you a no-show. If you accrue 3 no-shows within a year, your membership in the group will be suspended for 3 months.

In general, hosts will not be quick to dole out no-shows. However, if your failure to attend results in inconvenience for the host or other members, then it's quite likely you'll get a no-show. Some examples:

- The host makes a restaurant reservation for 10 and then only 4 people show up—if you are one of the 6 who didn't show up, then you'll get a no-show. Over-reserving tables can hurt our relationships with local venues.
- A conversation meetup has 6 RSVPs, but only 2 people show up—if you are one of the 4 who didn't show up, then you'll get a no-show. Hosts have the right to cancel events that are too small.

In the case where failure to attend results in the host losing money, the affected host can ban you from all her future events.
