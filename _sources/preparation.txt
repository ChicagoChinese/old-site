Mandarin Conversation Preparation
=================================

Thank you for your interest in our Mandarin conversation meetup! We’d like to take this opportunity to cordially remind you that this event is Mandarin-only. At minimum, please come prepared to answer these six basic questions in Mandarin. If you need to, it's OK to consult Google Translate [#]_. If you make any mistakes in your answers we'll be sure to (gently) correct you.

你叫什么？
  What's your name?

你来自哪里？
  Where do you come from?

你住在哪里？
  Where do you live?

你做什么工作？
  What do you do for a living?

你最喜欢吃什么？
  What do you most like to eat?

.. [#] But please note that you should never completely trust translations from Google Translate.
