Code of Conduct
===============

The Chicago Chinese Language Meetup Group is dedicated to providing a harassment-free community for everyone, regardless of sex, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, age, body size, race, nationality, or religious beliefs. We do not tolerate harassment of community members in any form. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the community at the discretion of the meetup organizers.

Harassment includes offensive verbal or written comments related to sex, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, age, body size, race, nationality, or religious beliefs, deliberate intimidation, threats, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any meetup event or communication channel. Community members asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in harassing behavior, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the community. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a meetup organizer or event host immediately.

If you have questions or feedback about this Code of Conduct please contact us at chicago.chinese.meetup@gmail.com.

The meetup organizers developed this Code of Conduct to govern all events and communication channels. We used the `Chicago Women Developerâ€™s Code of Conduct <http://www.meetup.com/WomanDevelopers/pages/Code_of_Conduct/>`_ as a starting point. This Code of Conduct, like its inspiration, is licensed under the `Creative Commons Zero license <https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/>`_.
