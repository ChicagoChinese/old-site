Meetup Description
==================

你好！If you're looking to learn or practice Chinese, you've come to the right place! If you're a native Mandarin speaker and would like to practice your English, we would also love to help! 如果你是汉语母语者而你想练习你的英文口语，我们想帮助你！

Meetup Types
------------

谈话 (conversation)
```````````````````

Please keep your English to a minimum at meetups specifically labeled “谈话”. It's OK if your spoken Chinese is limited, but we expect you to `be prepared to have a basic conversation <http://chicagochinese.github.io/preparation.html>`_. When learning a language, keep in mind that words don't come easily in the middle of a conversation until you've used them over and over again.

English for Mandarin speakers
`````````````````````````````

Since native Chinese speakers are kind enough to attend and help us with our Chinese, we want to return the favor and help them with their English. We'll do our best to ensure that there are a decent number of native English speakers in attendance.

社交/文化 (social/cultural)
```````````````````````````

We go out to eat, see plays, watch movies, and do anything else our members want. Feel free to send suggestions to the organizers. Chinese isn't required but you are welcome to use it.

读书会 (book club)
``````````````````

We have a book club for advanced language learners!
